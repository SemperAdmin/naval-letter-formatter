# Debug Logging Instructions

Your Naval Letter Formatter now includes optional debug logging that will show you when user actions occur. This logging only appears in development mode to help with troubleshooting.

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

1. **Removed excessive console spam** - No more character codes and content logging on every keystroke
2. **Suppressed browser extension errors** - Filters out "message channel closed" and similar extension conflicts
3. **Added structured debug logging** - Clean, organized logs for actual user actions

## 🔍 **Debug Logs You'll See**

When you interact with the application in development mode, you'll now see clean debug logs like:

### User Actions:
- `👆 User Action: Add Paragraph (main)` - When adding paragraphs
- `👆 User Action: Remove Paragraph` - When deleting paragraphs  
- `👆 User Action: Generate Document` - When generating documents
- `👆 User Action: Save Letter` - When saving letters
- `👆 User Action: Load Letter` - When loading saved letters

### Form Changes:
- `📝 Form Change: Subject = "YOUR SUBJECT TEXT"`
- `📝 Form Change: Paragraph 1 = "Your paragraph content..."`

### Error Logging:
- `🚨 Error in [Context]` - Enhanced error reporting with stack traces in development

## 🎛️ **How to Enable/Disable Debug Logging**

The debug logging is automatically enabled in development mode. 

- **Development mode**: Full debug logging with stack traces
- **Production mode**: Minimal error logging only

## 🧪 **Testing the Debug Logs**

Try these actions to see the debug logs:

1. **Type in the Subject field** - Should show form change logs
2. **Add a paragraph** - Should show "Add Paragraph" action
3. **Type in a paragraph** - Should show paragraph content changes
4. **Click Generate Document** - Should show generation action with details
5. **Save a letter** - Should show save action

## 🔧 **Console Filter Settings**

The application automatically:
- ✅ Suppresses browser extension errors
- ✅ Filters out repetitive validation warnings  
- ✅ Shows only relevant development information
- ✅ Provides enhanced error context in development

## 📝 **If You Need More Logging**

You can easily add more debug logging anywhere in the code using:

```typescript
import { debugUserAction, debugFormChange, logError } from '@/lib/console-utils';

// For user actions
debugUserAction('Action Name', { key: 'value' });

// For form changes
debugFormChange('Field Name', newValue);

// For errors
logError('Context Name', error);
```

The console should now be much cleaner and show meaningful information when you interact with the application!
